\# Airbnb Clone Backend ‚Äî Project Requirements



\## Objective

The goal of this project is to \*\*identify and document the key features and functionalities of the Airbnb Clone backend\*\*.  

This involves understanding the \*\*technical\*\* and \*\*functional\*\* requirements required to build a \*\*scalable, secure, and robust\*\* system that powers a rental marketplace platform.



---



\## Introduction

Backend development is the backbone of any web application.  

It handles \*\*server-side logic\*\*, \*\*database operations\*\*, \*\*authentication\*\*, and \*\*API integrations\*\* that connect the frontend with the core business logic.



For the \*\*Airbnb Clone Project\*\*, the backend will:

\- Manage user interactions (guests, hosts, and admins),

\- Handle property listings and bookings,

\- Process payments securely,

\- Manage reviews, notifications, and system monitoring.



The requirements are organized into three main sections:

1\. \*\*Core Functionalities\*\*

2\. \*\*Technical Requirements\*\*

3\. \*\*Non-Functional Requirements\*\*



---



\## Core Functionalities



\### 1. User Management

\- \*\*User Registration:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Users can sign up as \*\*guests\*\* or \*\*hosts\*\*.  

&nbsp; - Implement secure authentication using \*\*JWT (JSON Web Tokens)\*\*.

\- \*\*Login and Authentication:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Login via email and password.  

&nbsp; - Support third-party logins (OAuth via \*\*Google\*\*, \*\*Facebook\*\*).  

\- \*\*Profile Management:\*\*  

&nbsp; - Allow profile updates (photo, contact info, preferences).



---



\### 2. Property Listings Management

\- \*\*Add Listings:\*\*  

&nbsp; Hosts can create listings with details such as:

&nbsp; - Title, Description, Location, Price, Amenities, Availability.

\- \*\*Edit/Delete Listings:\*\*  

&nbsp; Hosts can update or remove their listings.



---



\### 3. Search and Filtering

\- Search by:

&nbsp; - Location  

&nbsp; - Price range  

&nbsp; - Number of guests  

&nbsp; - Amenities (Wi-Fi, pool, pet-friendly)

\- Include \*\*pagination\*\* for large datasets.



---



\### 4. Booking Management

\- \*\*Booking Creation:\*\*  

&nbsp; Guests can book properties for specific dates.

\- \*\*Validation:\*\*  

&nbsp; Prevent double bookings with date validation.

\- \*\*Cancellations:\*\*  

&nbsp; Allow guests and hosts to cancel bookings according to policy.

\- \*\*Booking Status:\*\*  

&nbsp; Track statuses such as \*\*pending\*\*, \*\*confirmed\*\*, \*\*canceled\*\*, or \*\*completed\*\*.



---



\### 5. Payment Integration

\- Integrate secure payment gateways like \*\*Stripe\*\* or \*\*PayPal\*\*.

\- Handle:

&nbsp; - Upfront payments from guests.

&nbsp; - Automatic payouts to hosts after bookings.

\- Support \*\*multiple currencies\*\*.



---



\### 6. Reviews and Ratings

\- Guests can leave reviews and ratings.

\- Hosts can respond to reviews.

\- Each review is linked to a verified booking to prevent misuse.



---



\### 7. Notifications System

\- Send \*\*email\*\* and \*\*in-app\*\* notifications for:

&nbsp; - Booking confirmations  

&nbsp; - Cancellations  

&nbsp; - Payment updates



---



\### 8. Admin Dashboard

\- Admins can manage and monitor:

&nbsp; - Users  

&nbsp; - Listings  

&nbsp; - Bookings  

&nbsp; - Payments



---



\## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements



\### 1. Database Management

\- Use a relational database such as \*\*PostgreSQL\*\* or \*\*MySQL\*\*.

\- Required tables:

&nbsp; - `Users` (guests and hosts)  

&nbsp; - `Properties`  

&nbsp; - `Bookings`  

&nbsp; - `Reviews`  

&nbsp; - `Payments`



---



\### 2. API Development

\- Develop \*\*RESTful APIs\*\* to connect backend to frontend.

\- Use proper HTTP methods:

&nbsp; - `GET` ‚Üí Retrieve data  

&nbsp; - `POST` ‚Üí Create data  

&nbsp; - `PUT/PATCH` ‚Üí Update data  

&nbsp; - `DELETE` ‚Üí Remove data

\- (Optional) Use \*\*GraphQL\*\* for complex queries.



---



\### 3. Authentication and Authorization

\- Use \*\*JWT\*\* for secure user sessions.

\- Implement \*\*Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\*\*:

&nbsp; - \*\*Guests:\*\* Book properties and leave reviews.  

&nbsp; - \*\*Hosts:\*\* Manage listings and view bookings.  

&nbsp; - \*\*Admins:\*\* Manage all users, listings, and transactions.



---



\### 4. File Storage

\- Store property images and user profile photos using:

&nbsp; - Cloud storage (e.g., \*\*AWS S3\*\*, \*\*Cloudinary\*\*), or  

&nbsp; - Local file storage (for simplicity in implementation).



---



\### 5. Third-Party Services

\- Use \*\*SendGrid\*\* or \*\*Mailgun\*\* for sending email notifications.



---



\### 6. Error Handling and Logging

\- Implement \*\*global API error handling\*\*.

\- Log critical events for monitoring and debugging.



---



\## Non-Functional Requirements



\### 1. Scalability

\- Design a \*\*modular architecture\*\* to allow easy scaling.

\- Use \*\*load balancers\*\* for horizontal scaling.



---



\### 2. Security

\- Protect sensitive data (passwords, payments) using \*\*encryption\*\*.

\- Implement:

&nbsp; - Firewalls  

&nbsp; - Rate limiting  

&nbsp; - Secure HTTPS connections



---



\### 3. Performance Optimization

\- Use \*\*Redis caching\*\* to speed up frequent queries.

\- Optimize database queries for better performance.



---



\### 4. Testing

\- Implement:

&nbsp; - \*\*Unit tests\*\* for components.  

&nbsp; - \*\*Integration tests\*\* for APIs using frameworks like \*\*pytest\*\*.

\- Automate API testing to ensure consistent behavior.
