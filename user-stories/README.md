\# 🧾 Airbnb Project — User Stories Documentation



\## 📘 Overview

This README provides an overview of the \*\*User Stories\*\* created for the \*\*Airbnb Clone Backend Project\*\*.  

The user stories are documented in the file \[`user-stories.md`] and are based on the \*\*use case diagram\*\* developed in the previous task.



The purpose of this document is to explain the \*\*essence and role of user stories\*\* in defining the functional scope of the backend system — ensuring all user interactions are clear, goal-oriented, and aligned with real-world use cases.

\## 🎯 Purpose of User Stories

User stories describe \*\*how different types of users interact with the system\*\* from their perspective.  

They focus on \*what\* users need and \*why\*, without specifying \*how\* the system should be built.  



In Agile development, user stories serve as:

\- A \*\*communication bridge\*\* between business requirements and technical implementation.

\- A way to \*\*prioritize\*\* backend features during development sprints.

\- A tool to \*\*validate\*\* that the final system meets user expectations and functional goals.

\## 🧩 Relationship to the Use Case Diagram

The user stories were directly derived from the \*\*Airbnb Clone Use Case Diagram\*\*, which identified the main system actors and their interactions.  



Each story translates a \*\*use case\*\* into a \*\*real-world scenario\*\* describing the user’s objective and motivation.  



For example:

> Use Case: “Register Account”  

> → User Story: “As a user, I want to register an account so that I can list my properties.”

\## 📜 Structure of the User Stories



Each user story follows the \*\*standard Agile format\*\*:



> \*\*As a \[type of user], I want \[action or goal] so that \[benefit or reason].\*\*



This format ensures each story:

\- Identifies the \*\*actor\*\* (Guest, Host, Admin).  

\- Describes the \*\*action or functionality\*\* requested.  

\- States the \*\*intended outcome or value\*\* of that functionality.
